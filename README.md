# Lumin - A JLS Fork
Lumin is a modernized fork of JLS (Java Logic Simulator), originally developed by David Poplawski, Joshua Marshall, and others.  

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.  
For more details, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

JLS was originally distributed under the GPL v3 license, and Lumin continues under the same licensing terms.  

## The Goal
JLS is what got me into logic and circuits in my Computer Organization class at Grand Valley. Though there are more
modern alternatives out there, JLS has a place in my heart, so I wanted to see if I could complete the task of bringing
JLS into reasonably-modern Java.
